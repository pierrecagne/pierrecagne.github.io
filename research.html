	<h2>PhD thesis</h2>
	
	<p>
	  Here is my PhD thesis
	  <object class="title">
	    <a href="cagne_thesis.pdf">Towards a homotopical algebra of dependent types</a>
	  </object>
	  (And the defense Beamer slides are <a href="phd_defense_slides.pdf">there</a>.)

	  <br/><br/>

	  It was co-directed by Paul-André Melliès, computer scientist
	  at Université Paris Diderot, and Clemens Berger,
	  mathematician at Université de Nice. I defended on December
	  7th, 2018 in front of the jury composed with: Clemens Berger
	  (advisor), Hugo Herbelin (president), André Joyal
	  (reviewer), Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine (examiner), Paul-André
	  Melliès (advisor), Simona Paoli (examiner), Emily Riehl
	  (examiner) and Thomas Streicher (reviewer).
	</p>

	<p>
	  Very broadly, my thesis is a quest for categorical
	  structures that can be used to interprete Martin-Löf's type
	  theories and variants of such. One of the main goal is to
	  reconcile Lawvere's view on categorical logic that he
	  developed through hyperdoctrines and the likes with the
	  type-as-fibrations philosophy initiated by Awodey and Warren
	  and greatly advocated by Voevodsky in the description of its
	  model of univalence in the category of simplicial sets.
	</p>
	<p>
	  In the process, with collaborators, we have designed a
	  structure mixing Grothendieck bifibrations and model
	  categories, and a theorem allowing for a generic
	  construction of these structures. This result can be
	  interpreted as a Grothendieck construction for pseudo
	  functors valued in the 2-category of Quillen model
	  structures, left Quillen functors between them and natural
	  transformations. Hence we named Quillen bifibrations the new
	  structures. The theorem about Quillen bifibrations can be
	  understood without any reference to type theory and applies
	  in particular to the construction of Reedy model
	  structures. Homotopy categories of Quillen bifibrations have
	  a peculiar behaviour and can be constructed in two
	  successives localizations. What is odd is that both
	  localization can be obtained by Quillen's homotopy quotient
	  of a model category. The only subtility is that the
	  intermediary model category might not have all pushouts or
	  pullbacks: based on works by Jeff Egger, we show that
	  Quillen's construction of the localization can still be
	  carried out in that larger settings. In the study of thes
	  homotopy category for Quillen bifibrations, it appears that
	  there should be a variation on the structure of Grothendieck
	  bifibration where (some of) the push functors are only
	  defined up to homotopy.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The last part of the work I conducted in this thesis is an
	  attempt to use the intuition developped through Quillen
	  bifibrations in order to propose a treatment of Joyal's
	  tribes in a fibrational setting. Tribes are minimalistic
	  structures to interprete HoTT. They are reminiscent of
	  Brown's categories of fibrant objects. Through the
	  fibrational view, path objects in tribes can be understood
	  as a result of "pushing" the terminal dependent type above a
	  base type A over its diagonal. However this push is of the
	  previously mentioned flavour: the universal property it
	  satisfies is a homotopy universal property. Nevertheless
	  this understanding of tribes makes a clear connection with
	  Lawvere's view of the equality predicates in first-order
	  logic (or even in extensional dpendent type theory): in a
	  hyperdoctrine, the equality predicate for objects of sort A
	  is the image (push) over the diagonal of the total predicate
	  on A. In this work, we have designed a fibrational structure
	  that generalizes tribes. To do so, we develop a framework
	  for <em>relative</em> (orthogonal or weak) factorization
	  systems: this is a 2-level version of the usual
	  factorization systems, from which we recover the usual
	  notion in degenerate cases.

	<!--   <object class="title">Generalized species, linear logic and -->
	<!--     enriched homotopy theory</object> -->
	  
	<!--   It is co-directed by Paul-André Melliès, computer scientist -->

	<!-- <p>Let me give a quick introduction about it. The bicategory -->
	<!-- of distributors, introduced by Jean Bénabou, can interprete -->
	<!-- linear logic through the following semantic of the exponential -->
	<!-- comonad: any small category \(\mathcal A\) gets mapped to the -->
	<!-- small category \(S\mathcal A\) -->

	<!--   <ul> -->
	<!--     <li> whose objects are finite tuples \((a_1,\ldots,a_n)\) -->
	<!--       of objects of \(\mathcal A\),</li> -->
	<!--     <li> and whose morphisms \((a_1,\ldots,a_m) \to -->
	<!--       (a'_1,\ldots,a'_n)\) are defined only for \(m=n\) and -->
	<!--       are tuples \((\sigma,f_1,\ldots,f_n)\) where \(\sigma\) -->

	<!--   </ul> -->
	<!--   As such, the co-Kleisli bicategory associated to the comonad -->
	<!--   \(S\) is the bicategory of generalized species of -->
	<!--   structures, introduced by Martin Hyland and its -->
	<!--   school. Coincidentally, the monads (in Street's sense) of -->
	<!--   this bicategory are the set-theoretic operads with colours -->
	<!--   in \(\mathcal A\). -->
	<!-- </p> -->

	<!-- <p> -->
	<!--   The goal of this thesis is to bring this bridge between -->
	<!--   operads and intuitionnistic linear proofs to a homotopical -->
	<!--   framework so as to match topological/simplicial coloured -->

	<h2>Undergraduate research experience</h2>

	<p>
	  <h3>Master of Research in CS</h3> I graduated from
	  &Eacute;cole Normale Supérieure in Computer Science by doing
	  a 5 month research internship under the supervision of
	  Paul-André Melliès. During it I designed a categorical
	  framework, based on monads with arities, suitable to model
	  memory allocation and deallocation in a quantum program
	  (more generally in a program with linear ressource
	  managment). Get
	  the <a href="mpri_m2_cagne_report.pdf">mémoire</a> (in
	  french) and the
	  <a href="mpri_m2_slides.pdf">oral presentation</a>.
	</p>
	  
	<p>
	  <h3>Master of Research in
	    Mathematics</h3> <a href="memoire_m2_cagne.pdf">Here</a>
	    (in french) is my master thesis in mathematics. It was
	    directed
	    by <a href="http://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~georges.maltsiniotis/">Georges
	    Maltsiniotis</a> and focused on the proof that
	  <a href="http://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/~dcisinsk/">Denis-Charles
	    Cisinski</a> gave of a conjecture made by Grothendieck in
	    Pursuing Stacks: any basic localizer contains the weak
	    homotopy equivalences.
	</p>

	<p>
	  <h3>Master of Research in Mathematics (1st
	    year)</h3> <a href="cagne_rapport_ter_m1.pdf">This</a> (in
	    french) is my first year master's thesis, about the use of
	    Grothendieck toposes to prove the independance of the
	    Continuum Hypothesis relatively to the theory ZFC. (There
	    might be some imprecisions and wrong results too.)
	</p>
	  
	<p>
	  <h3>Master of Research in CS (1st year)</h3> The first year
	  of the Master of Research at &Eacute;cole Normale Supérieure
	  requires a research intership that I have performed at
	  Université du Québec à Montréal in team LaCIM under the
	  direction
	  of <a href="http://www.lacim.uqam.ca/~brlek/">Sre&#269;ko
	  Brlek</a>. The partially achived goal was to prove a
	  conjecture about the conservation of the tiling property for
	  a polyomino under some transformations.  There is a report
	  that I will put here someday... maybe... if I finally fix
	  some issues in there.  But you can have a look at
	  the <a href="gtgeo2013/main.pdf">presentation</a> (in
	  english) of the result I did in a workshop.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  <h3>Bachelor's Degree Internship</h3> I completed my
	  bachelor degree in Computer Science at &Eacute;cole Normale
	  Supérieure, that requires a 2 to 3 mounth research
	  internship. I worked at LORIA (Nancy) in team ADAGIo under
	  the supervision
	  of <a href="http://www.loria.fr/~jamet/index.html">Damien
	  Jamet</a> and Eric Domenjoud. It was about counting and
	  generating local configurations of discretized planes. The
	  internship included
	  a <a href="internship_l3/index.html">coding part</a> and a
	  theoretical one. Get
	  the <a href="internship_l3/report.pdf">report</a> (in
	  french).
